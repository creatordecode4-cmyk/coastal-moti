# Asset & third-party licenses

Rule: every file under `/assets` and `/vendor` that we did not make ourselves gets ONE line here
**before** it is committed. Only CC0 or clearly commercial-use-allowed licenses. No exceptions.

Format: `name | author | URL | license | where it is used`

## Third-party code

- three.js 0.160.0 (`vendor/three.module.min.js`) | three.js authors | https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js | MIT (full text in `vendor/THREE-LICENSE.txt`) | 3D rendering engine

## Third-party art, audio, fonts

- None yet. Sky, sea, terrain, characters and props are generated in code; sounds are synthesized in code;
  the UI uses the device's system font.
